There are currently two ways to build cil: the old Makefile-based way,
and the faster ocamlbuild-based way. If you go the latter route, there
are a few assumptions made by the CIL distribution, so it's better to
"make ocamlbuild" rather than directly running ocamlbuild.

CIL has a C file that does some performance counter stuff, which it
statically links against. This is fine by itself, but makes cil.cma
unable to load by the toplevel. We can create a custom toplevel
specifically for CIL, but that toplevel would fail to load other
libraries that depend on any libraries not linked in by CIL. This
frustration motivated me to change CIL to dynamic linking.

ocamlbuild is faster, but customizing it is confusing, especially in
dealing with C stubs. I find the old Makefile more pleasant to work
with. I've made changes in the following ways:
  1. Change ocaml toolchain to use native binaries, speeding things up a lot!
  2. Make the cilly target depend on cillib
  3. Change static linking to dynamic linking. 
Because we changed to dynamic linking, ocaml must know where to find the .so:
   sudo sh -c "echo $(ocamlfind query cil) >> $(ocamlfind printconf ldconf)"

We do not want to build everything during development. We only build
bytecode, because of its support of debugging and incremental compilation.
To create type annotations for use with Emacs, we do
   make cilly COMPILEFLAGS+="-annot"

The emacs mode that comes with ocaml can show type information
annotated by the compiler with -annot (-dtypes is deprecated). Tuareg
borrows this feature too.

To get native code, add NATIVECAML=1 to that make line.
Even better, add UNSAFE=1
To debug makefile, add ECHOSTYLE_SCOTT=1

To manage CIL with findlib (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html),
refer to the 'install-findlib' target in the Makefile. Or, we can simply do:
   cd ~/cil
   ln -s `pwd`/META obj/x86_LINUX/
   sudo ln -s `pwd`/obj/x86_LINUX/ `ocamlfind printconf path`/cil

Now, to use CIL as a lib, do something like this:
   ocamlfind ocamlc -verbose -package cil -linkpkg extension.ml
Or to use ocaml-batteries as a drop-in replacement, do
   ocamlfind batteries/ocamlc -package cil extension.ml -o extension
