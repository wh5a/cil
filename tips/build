There are currently two ways to build cil: the old Makefile-based way,
and the faster ocamlbuild-based way. If you go the latter route, there
are a few assumptions made by the CIL distribution, so it's better to
"make ocamlbuild" rather than directly running ocamlbuild.

We do not want to build everything during development. We only build
bytecode, because of its support of debugging and incremental compilation.
To create type annotations for use with Emacs, we do
   make cilly cillib COMPILEFLAGS+="-annot"

The emacs mode that comes with ocaml can show type information
annotated by the compiler with -annot (-dtypes is deprecated). Tuareg
borrows this feature too.

To get native code, add NATIVECAML=1 to that make line.
Even better, add UNSAFE=1
To debug makefile, add ECHOSTYLE_SCOTT=1

To manage CIL with findlib (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html),
refer to the 'install-findlib' target in the Makefile. Or, we can simply do:
   cd ~/cil
   ln -s `pwd`/META obj/x86_LINUX/
   sudo ln -s `pwd`/obj/x86_LINUX/ `ocamlfind printconf path`/cil

Now, to use CIL as a lib, do something like this:
   ocamlfind ocamlc -verbose -package cil -linkpkg extension.ml
Or to use ocaml-batteries as a drop-in replacement, do
   ocamlfind batteries/ocamlc -package cil extension.ml -o extension
